# CSC8635-Machine-Learning

• Designed and deployed Machine Learning models for Twitter sentiment analysis, utilising Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine Classifier.

• Plotted WordClouds to analyse dataset for each sentiment category: positive, neutral, and negative.

• To improve model accuracy, Removed English stop words, punctuation, usernames, repeated words, and links.

• Utilised Lemmatization technique to standardise and reduce words, aiding in the extraction of core meanings.

• Implemented Tokenization to break tweets into individual tokens, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features.

• Implemented a pipeline incorporating natural language processing (NLP) algorithms for text classification, achieving higher accuracy with techniques such as TF-IDF.

• Conducted F1-score evaluation to assess model performance, achieving 78% accuracy with a Support Vector Machine classifier.



## Data:

The data for **Twitter Sentiment Analysis** can be found in the `"Text"` folders, while the **weather data** is located in the `"Time Series"` folders.

## Code:

The python code is available in `code.ipynb` file.

## Other files:

`GRU_LSTM_checkpoint.keras` is a keras file which stores weights of the trained models. To use this weights as it is you just need to load it into your model architecture.
